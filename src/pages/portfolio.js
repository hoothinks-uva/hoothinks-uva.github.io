The one they had previously was poorly designed, hard to update, and contained walls of hard to read text. Half of it was still boilerplate in French.", "The goal of the project was to quantify the opinion of a population. The problem that lies is itâ€™s difficult to get an accurate picture of the feelings of a group and to develop a rating. The solution that was devised was to use sentiment analysis combined with Web scraping to look through sub reddit communities to get data so opinions could be gauged."]
